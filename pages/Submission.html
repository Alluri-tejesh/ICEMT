      Authors should submit a paper in English that addresses one or more of the conference areas or subjects and is carefully vetted for good grammar and spelling. Each work should explicitly state the technical/scientific contribution it makes, as well as the challenges, topics, or contexts to which it applies. Papers should only be submitted if they are original.

Authors are advised to follow ethical norms regarding plagiarism and self-plagiarism thoroughly before submitting and must make sure that their submissions do not substantially overlap work which has been published elsewhere or simultaneously submitted to a journal or another conference with proceedings. Papers that contain any form of plagiarism will be rejected without reviews.

Authors can submit their work as a Regular Paper, which represents completed and validated research, or as a Position Paper, which represents a short report of ongoing work or an argumentative opinion on an issue, discussing ideas, facts, situations, methods, procedures, or results of scientific research focused on one of the conference topic areas. The online submission platform (easychair portal) is required for all papers. The authors will receive an automatic confirmation e-mail once the manuscript submission has been successfully done.
